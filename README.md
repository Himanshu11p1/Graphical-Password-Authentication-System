# Graphical-Password-Authentication-System
It is build to improve password security of user.RC4 encryption is used to give an extra layer of protection.
This file contains the implementation details and documentation for a Graphical Password Authentication System based on the RC4 algorithm. The system leverages the strength of the RC4 algorithm, a symmetric key stream cipher, to provide secure authentication through graphical password schemes.

Key Features:

RC4 Algorithm Integration: The system utilizes the RC4 algorithm to encrypt and decrypt graphical passwords, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
Graphical Passwords: Instead of traditional alphanumeric passwords, users create and authenticate using graphical passwords, enhancing security and usability.
User-Friendly Interface: The system offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to set up and authenticate with their graphical passwords.
Random Password Generation: The system provides the option for users to generate random graphical passwords, ensuring a high level of complexity and unpredictability.
Strong Encryption: All graphical passwords are securely encrypted using the RC4 algorithm, making them resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
Password Management: The system incorporates password management features, allowing users to update, reset, and recover their graphical passwords easily.
Robust Authentication: The authentication process includes multiple layers of security checks, such as image distortion, grid-based selection, and user-specific challenges, to prevent unauthorized access.
